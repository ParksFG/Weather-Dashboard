# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project was a test of everything I've been working to develop over the last two months, and some server-side api testing.  I built this project to have easy access to checking the weather before a vacation or before you go out on the town. The whole project really helped me realize how much I've improved and how to deal with api calls.
